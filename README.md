Service Request Tracker
=======================

This web application is built for the City of Chicago as an interface to service requests submitted through their 311 system. It uses Chicago's Open311 API---including Chicago-specific extensions---to provide listings, lookups and subscription capabilities.

It includes the following components:
 - A web application for listing service requests, searching for a specific service request based on ID, and subscribing to email updates for specific service requests
 - A python script (in `/updater`) that checks the Open311 endpoint for

Installation & Configuration
----------------------------

You need to install an open311 compliant API server first, it is by default expected to be run on port 5000.
see http://open311.org for more details.

SRTracker's `app.py` web app requires the following python modules :

- flask
  debian package : python-flask - micro web framework based on Werkzeug, Jinja2 and good intentions

- requests 
  debian package : python-requests - elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings

- iso8601
  no debian package,
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/iso8601/
  pip-2.6 install iso8601

- dateutil 
  debian package : python-dateutil - powerful extensions to the standard datetime module

- psycopg2
  debian package : python-psycopg2 - Python-Modul for PostgreSQL

- configuration
 copy the file updater/configuration.py.example to updater/configuration.py and edit.

see also requirements.txt for detailed packages and version numbers.

Database for testing has been set to sqlite, 
the database model is defined in "updater/models.py", 

HACK: I added the database creation code directly into updater/update.py, this is not a good idea for production code, but for testing it should be ok.

SRTracker's `app.py` web app requires the following environment variables:

- `OPEN311_SERVER`: the fully qualified URL for the endpoint server, e.g. _'http://311.baltimorecity.gov/open311/v2'_
- `OPEN311_API_KEY`: the API key, [if necessary](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2/Servers), for the Open311 server
- `PASSWORD_PROTECTED`: Whether SRTracker requires a password to access; for example, if it accesses a private/internal Open311 API
- `PASSWORD`: the password necessary to access this SRTracker instance

SRTracker's `updater.py` email update script requires email, database and other environment variables as defined in [`configuration_environ.py`](https://github.com/codeforamerica/srtracker/blob/master/updater/configuration_environ.py).

Chicago-specific Open311 Extensions
-----------------------------------

This application relies upon extensions to the [Open311 GeoReport v2 Spec](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2) that are specific to Chicago (for the time being). These include:

- `updated_at` parameter: allows sorting requests by when they were updated, not just initially requests
- `notes` field: individual requests may have additional "follow-on" requests that define additional work/activities related to the initial request which are exposed in the `notes` field of an individual service request
